#pulse 
is a personal project where it will help with a workflow for said people. For the people that understand IT you can link this to a VPN and access it anywhere in the world. However you dont need to do this it will just be on a local pc if u wanted it to be.

Its purpose?
Its purpose is to make life easier. In a day and age where AI and data is everything it is important for your data and mangement of the data to be safety secure to where you know it will be. Furthermore, you would have complete and utter creative freedom to change and apdat what you personally want or need. 


How does it work?
Pulse is simple. It uses ollama 3.2. The reason behind that its because it is lightwieght which means it should work on most morden laptops and PCs. There will be away to see if your hardware is compitable later on. Furthermore, it will use whisper By OpenAI for text-to-speech and Google text to speech (gTTS). I would further use AES-256. As it is the most safest one. If you have any sercuity considers then please read DATA_&_Safety_policy.md
